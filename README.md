# About

This is a small plugin that can generate information for auditing purposes. A unit of information for that purpose is called an auditing record.

For REST APIs, **CRUD operations of users on resources** can be monitored. For every request an **auditing event** is emitted. An event handler is provided to haÎ½dle the event.

Two events are pre-configured:

- **SEARCH**
- **MUTATION**

All **GET requests** are considered **SEARCH events**. A Mutation event can be one of **POST, PUT, DELETE requests**. An event is also correlated with an ACTION. For Mutation events:

- **PUT** request is an **UPDATE** action
- **POST** request is a **CREATE** action
- **DELETE** request is a **DELETE** action

For mutations, the affected entity, its id and the values (payload) before and after the action are recorded. A diff fuction computes the differences observed as a result of the action. Users can bind their own function implementations, although a reference implementation may be provided in the future for comleteness.
